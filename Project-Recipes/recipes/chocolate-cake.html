        <h2>Recipe for a Simple 'N' Delicious Chocolate Cake</h2>

        <p>The Best Chocolate Cake Recipe - A one bowl chocolate cake recipe that is quick, easy, and delicious!</p>

        <p>Here's another great thing about this recipe. The cake batter really can be made in a bowl without the use of a heavy duty mixer. Of course, that just makes things easier, but this is easily a recipe my Grandmother would have enjoyed making in her tiny kitchen with a whisk and a bowl. And I'm sure it would have turned out perfectly, too.</p>
